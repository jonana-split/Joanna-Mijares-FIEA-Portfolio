# Bee Game
This is a simple C# code for a minigame in a group project game I worked on. This minigame level was designed and programmed on my own. This was in Spring 2023, so it is one of my older projects, but I believe it adds to my story as one of my first independent pieces of game code.

## File Contents
### DetectNote.cs
In this minigame the player is a bee who must hop on a piano and play notes in the correct order to escape a room. I have attached a screenshot of the level.
