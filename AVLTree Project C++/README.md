# AVL Tree Project

This project focuses on creating an AVL tree data structure. The AVL Tree project involved creating a tree and its nodes, along with rotating, inserting, deleting, and sorting nodes. This was one of my larger projects I have had to tackle.

## File Contents
### AVLTree.cpp
This is the file with the most code. This is where the AVL tree is structured along with several helper functions. 
### AVLTree.h
The header file where functions are established.
### main.cpp
A main file to create the AVL tree and take in commands.
### test.cpp
A file with several tests to ensure my tree works and was structured correctly.
