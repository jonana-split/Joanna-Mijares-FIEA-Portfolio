# Memory Manager Project
This was a project in which I created a Memory Management system using linked lists. We were required to use valgrind to ensure there were zero memory leaks or issues, and my project had no leaks.

## File Contents

### MemoryManager.h
This is where my linked lists nodes that represented blocks of memory were created along with all functions used in this project.
