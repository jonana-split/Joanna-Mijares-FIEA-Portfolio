# PageRank Project

This project focuses on making a PageRank system, similar to what Google employs when determining website popularity. Using an adjacency list, websites and their degrees of connection were taken into consideration to develop an accurate ranking.

## File Contents
### AdjacencyList.cpp
This is where websites are parsed and ranked.
### AdjacencyList.h
The header file where functions are established.
### main.cpp
A main file to create the list of websites and power iterations.
### test.cpp
A file with several tests to ensure my ranking system worked.
