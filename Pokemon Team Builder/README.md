# Pokemon Team Builder Project
This project is an example of my work in creating a Red-Black Tree. I was charged with making an ordered map data structure using Red-Black trees in order to provide another method of sorting Pokemon. This was a group project, but this data structure was created by me.

## File Contents
### ordered_map.js
This is where the ordered map was created and the Pokemon were subsequently sorted.
