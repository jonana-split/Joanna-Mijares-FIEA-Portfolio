# Server Program
This was the creation of a server in C++ for my Operating Systems course. This brief project involved the creation of a server and 'wall' where individuals could leave messages.

## File Contents
### server.cpp
The server and wall were established in this file. Wall contents are erased once there are more than 20 messages, and messages to the wall must be saved between instances of the server.
