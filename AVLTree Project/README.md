# AVL Tree Project

This project focuses on creating an AVL tree data structure. This was created in Spring 2024 for my Data Structures and Algorithms course.
The AVL Tree project involved creating a tree and its nodes, along with rotating, inserting, deleting, and sorting nodes.

## File Contents
### AVLTree.cpp
This is the file with the most code. This is where the AVL tree is structured along with several helper functions.
### AVLTree.h
The header file where functions are established.
### main.cpp
A main file to create the AVL tree and take in commands.
### test.cpp
A file with several tests to ensure my tree works and was structured correctly.
